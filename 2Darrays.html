			AN ARRAY OF ARRAYS
		</h6>
		
		<p class = "lessonformat">
			We know that arrays can hold primitive data types and reference data types. Has it ever crossed your mind, that perhaps... An array could hold OTHER arrays? That's what a 2D array essentially is; <b>an array of arrays</b>.
		</p>

		<p class = "lessonformat">
			Consider a chart of integers like the following:
		</p>

		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>5</td>
				<td>622</td>
				<td>54</td>
				<td>98</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>231</td>
				<td>1</td>
				<td>544</td>
				<td>612</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>9</td>
				<td>34</td>
				<td>314</td>
				<td>2</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p class = "lessonformat">
			How would you represent that with arrays? Well, you could do this with something called <b>parallel arrays</b>. Each row would be represented by 1 individual array, declared something like:
		</p>

		<b><p class = "lessonformatcode">
			int [] row1 = {5, 622, 54, 98}; <br>
			int [] row2 = {231, 1, 544, 612}; <br>
			int [] row3 = {9, 34, 314, 2}; <br>
		</p></b>

		<p class = "lessonformat">
			That took 4 lines to declare a single chart. Imagine what would happen when declaring 100 rows as arrays. To make this more efficient, we can instead represent the chart with a <b>2D array</b>! Consider the following statement:
		</p>

		<b><p class = "lessonformatcode">
			int [] [] chart = {{5, 622, 54, 98}, {231, 1, 544, 612}, {9, 34, 314, 2}};
		</p></b>

		<p class = "lessonformat">
			This line did the exact same thing as the 3 arrays we declared earlier! So... How does it work?
		</p>

		<p class = "lessonformat">
			The variable declaration for a 2D array is almost identical to a 1D array (or a regular one). The only difference is that you declare two pairs of square brackets (like this: [] []) instead of only 1 pair. Its format will thus be <b><style class = "code">DataType [] [] nameOfArray</style></b>. Notably, a <b>2D array can be of 1 data type</b>, and is also not mutable.
		</p>

		<p class = "lessonformat">
			The initialization for a 2D array is, however, slightly different. For a default initialization, you would need to use the <b>new</b> keyword, followed by the array's data type, and  2 pairs of square brackets that set the number of rows and columns in the array (think of a 2D array like a grid!) For example, if I wanted to create a 2D array that has 4 rows and 5 columns, I would write <b><style class = "code">new DataType[4][5]</style></b>. If I wanted to initialize my 2D array with values, I would fill the 2D array like a 1D array except instead of having each element be a single value, each element will now represent 1 row in the column.
		</p>

		<p class = "lessonformat">
			Confused yet? Don't worry, so was I at first! To better understand how this works, consider this intialization:
		</p>

		<b><p class = "lessonformatcode">
			int [] [] chart = { {5, 62, 56, 45}, {23, 56, 23, 456}, {80, 4, 7, 3}, {87, 94, 67, 32}}; //entire chart, each row encased in {} and separated by a comma
		</p></b>	

		<p class = "lessonformat">
			Versus this one:
		</p>

		<b><p class = "lessonformatcode">
			int [] [] chart = { {5, 62, 56, 45}, //row 1 <br>
			  <span class = "tab"></span><span class = "tab"></span><span class = "tab"></span><span class = "tab"></span>{23, 56, 23, 456}, //row 2<br>
			  <span class = "tab"></span><span class = "tab"></span><span class = "tab"></span><span class = "tab"></span>{80, 4, 7, 3}, //row 3<br>
			  <span class = "tab"></span><span class = "tab"></span><span class = "tab"></span><span class = "tab"></span>{87, 94, 67, 32}};//row 4<br>
		</p></b>

		<p class = "lessonformat">
			They are exactly the same, just formatted differently! Think of it like initializing an array inside of an array. For the purpose of this tutorial, all the rows will have the same number of elements, which creates a <b>rectangular array</b>. It's possible to create an <b>irregular array</b>, with rows of different lengths, but that is beyond the scope of this tutorial.
		</p>	

		<p class = "lessonformat">
			So, how do we modify or access any of the elements in a 2D array? This is where things might get a bit complicated, and why it's important to think of a 2D array like a grid.
		</p>

			Let's say we want to access the value 5 in the 2D array. 5 is located at row 0, column 0. Therefore, to access the value, we would write something like <b><style class = "code">variable = array[0][0]</style></b>. We access the <b>row number</b> with the first <b><style class = "code">[]</style></b>, and the <b>column number</b> with the second <b><style class = "code">[]</style></b>. Let's take a look at an example code that organizes a set of YouTubers and their information into an array.

			I know, I know; it's a lot to take in, even with the comments. So, allow me to break it down for you!<br><br>
			
			This assignment asked us to <b>use 2D arrays to rate an object of our choice</b>. Thus, we decided to rate 8 YouTubers based on their popularities. This would be determined by their number of subscribers, if they're family friendly, number of videos they upload per month, and what type of content they create. To utilize 2D arrays, we used a 2D array to hold all this information. For this particular assignment, we were given bonus marks if we were to get all the information we needed to rate the YouTubers from a file. As ICS4U0 students, we kind of needed all the marks we could get to make up for any future failures, so we gave it a shot.<br><br> 

			Firstly, we have 3 import statements. These are <b>NOT</b> necessary when working with 2D arrays; they were simply used to read in information from a file. Next, we have our instance variables. The first one, as described in the program, will create a 2D String array with 6 rows and 8 columns called youTuber. Now hold on; <b>why 6 rows?</b> We only had 5 pieces of information about our YouTubers (channel name, subscribers, content type, average video uploads per month, family friendly). Well, we created 6 rows since <b>the last row will hold the number of points the YouTuber scores after we rate them</b> based on a criteria I will not get into for this example. The other thing I wanted to mention was our 2D array's data type. Even though some our data are booleans or integers, <b>we can't hold different data types in a 2D array</b>. Thus, it made the most sense to read in all the information as a String before parsing the Strings (if necessary) to their respected data types. The second variable isn't important for this example, but feel free to read the comment above it to see what its purpose is.<br><br>
			Next was the hard part; reading in information from a file and assigning the information into the 2D array. Firstly, we needed to have a plan on how to read in the information. We were thinking it would be easy to traverse the 2D array with nested for loops (more on traversing if you scroll down), but we needed to organize the 2D array so that all the information lined up properly to have the first 5 rows look something like this:

		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>channelName0</td> 				
				<td>channelName1</td>
				<td>channelName2</td>
				<td>channelName3</td>
				<td>channelName4</td>
				<td>channelName5</td>
				<td>channelName6</td>
				<td>channelName7</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>subscriber0</td> 				
				<td>subscriber1</td>
				<td>subscriber2</td>
				<td>subscriber3</td>
				<td>subscriber4</td>
				<td>subscriber5</td>
				<td>subscriber6</td>
				<td>subscriber7</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>contentType0</td> 				
				<td>contentType1</td>
				<td>contentType2</td>
				<td>contentType3</td>
				<td>contentType4</td>
				<td>contentType5</td>
				<td>contentType6</td>
				<td>contentType7</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>uploads0</td> 				
				<td>uploads1</td>
				<td>uploads2</td>
				<td>uploads3</td>
				<td>uploads4</td>
				<td>uploads5</td>
				<td>uploads6</td>
				<td>uploads7</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>familyFriendly0</td> 				
				<td>familyFriendly1</td>
				<td>familyFriendly2</td>
				<td>familyFriendly3</td>
				<td>familyFriendly4</td>
				<td>familyFriendly5</td>
				<td>familyFriendly6</td>
				<td>familyFriendly7</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

			Having this structure would allow all the information to line up with each other, with each individual YouTuber and their information taking up 1 column in the array. But how would we translate this to code? As usual, our ideas were easier said than done. Nonetheless, we started by creating a variable called <b><style class = "code">lineNum</style></b>, which would count which file number we were on in the file. Since our file was organized in the order of channel names, subscribers, content type, videos per month then family friendly, and each category took up 8 lines, we figured that as long as we keep track of what line the program was reading in we would know which row of the array to assign information to. <br><br> 
			Thus, we created a while loop to keep checking if the file has any more lines to read in our file. Then, we created a for loop meant to iterate through every column in the youTuber array. Note the condition for the for loop; we specifically used <b><style class = "code">youTuber[0].length</style></b> to get the number of columns. A common mistake is to use <b><style class = "code">youTuber.length</style></b>, but this only returns the number of rows, which would be inadequate as it wouldn't traverse through the columns. <br><br>
			Inside the for loop, we created an if statement that essentially checks which line the program is reading in next. If the line being read in was one of the first 8 lines, then it gets assigned to the first row. If its the next 8 lines, then it gets assigned to the second, and this continues for each row. This was the most efficient solution Nancy and I could think of, as it reads in all the information in 1 code structure rather than having, say 5 for loops to do the same thing but assign the information to different rows.<br><br>
			Notably, this part of the assignment didn't happen without mistakes. For example, we had to remember to increment <b><style class = "code">lineNum</style></b> after a line was read in to ensure that the if statement was being tested correctly. We also needed to be meticulous about our if statements. <br><br>
			<b>A common mistake</b> would be to have our if-else statements check <b><style class = "code">lineNum</style></b> from smaller values to greater. For example, let's say the condition <b><style class = "code">lineNum >= 8</style></b> was the first condition in the if-else statement. This would work for the first 8 lines, but what would happen when we move past the 8 lines we were supposed to read? When <b><style class = "code">lineNum = 16</style></b>, we are supposed to start assigning values to the third row. Yet, when <b><style class = "code">lineNum = 16</style></b>, it's still fulfilling the <b><style class = "code">lineNum >= 8</style></b> condition which results in the information being stored in the wrong row. However, when we order our if-else statements to test for larger numbers before smaller numbers, this allows us to check the right conditions. Instead of thinking "Oh, lineNum is >= 8, let's execute this" we now can think "lineNum is >= 8 BUT lineNum is also >= 16, and lineNum >= 16 is placed higher in the if-statement so I'll execute that first." As a general rule of thumb, <b>it's best to order your if-else statements from least-likely to most-likely to ensure that no least-likely options appear before the most-likely.</b>

			TRAVERSING 2D ARRAYS
		</h6>

		<p class = "lessonformat">
			2D arrays are great, but how do we go about traversing them? An example way to traverse them was shown previously but it might not be so clear how it was done. To traverse 2D arrays, we need nested for loops. In other words, we need <b>a for loop IN a for loop</b>! This way, we have one loop that will traverse through the rows, and another that will traverse the columns! 
		</p>

		<p class = "lessonformat">
			Take a look at the example code below which shows how to traverse a 2D array. Assume that grid has been properly declared and initialized.
		</p>

		<b><p class = "lessonformatcode">
			for (int row = 0; row < grid.length; row ++) { // Iterates through each row. grid.length returns the number of rows. <br>
			<span class="tab"></span>for (int col = 0; col < grid[0].length; col ++) { //Iterates through all columns. grid[0].length returns the number of columns. <br>
			<span class="tab"></span><span class="tab"></span> System.out.print(grid[row][col] + " "); //Outputs all the numbers in one row <br>
			<span class="tab"></span>}<br>
			<span class="tab"></span>System.out.println("");//Moves the cursor to the next line to start a new row<br>
			}<br><br>
			/** The outer loop runs until there are no rows left to iterate, or grid.length times. The inner for loop runs grid.length * grid[0].length times. */
