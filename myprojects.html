			Welcome! Here, I feature some of the best programming projects I've worked on during my high school career (aside from this website!)

			This was a Christmas-themed card I created with Processing in grade 9. I was unfortunately unable to submit this, as I had not created a proper plan for it, but I believe it's one of my best drawings created with only code.

			I created this in grade 9 for my ICS2O3 final project with Processing. The task was to create an animation that included various elements such as diagonal movement, rotation, and at least 4 different characters. I went with the theme of animals, and created an animation which followed an elephant, pig, bunny and mouse and their journey to a tea party. But wait, something prevents their tea party from happening. Pig is still stuck in the air! This fun assignment taught me how to use different shapes such as beziers and ellipses to create animations.

			This was a Hangman game that Nancy Zhu (a fellow programmer) and I developed for our ICS3UP final project using Java (version 1.4) in Ready to Program. The program is fully functional, and has the option to play on 2 difficulty levels,  view your high score (and compare with other people!), view instructions, and quit the game if wanted. Nancy and I worked on the actual game (choosing words, removing letters while playing) together. I primarily worked with the High Score method, which records everybody who plays and their points into a file and displays an organized scoreboard each time a player wants to see the scoreboard.

			In May 8-9 of 2021, I plan to further engage my learning in the computer science field by attending my first Hackathon, sponsored by TOHacks! I also intend to take the AP computer science exam by May 18th of 2021. <br> Image Credit: Christian Wiediger, <a href = "https://unsplash.com/photos/WkfDrhxDMC8" target = "_blank">Unsplash</a>
